## Our Standards

All contributors, maintainers, and participants are expected to uphold the following standards:

- **Be Collaborative:** Engage constructively, seek understanding, and respect differing viewpoints. Offer and accept constructive feedback.
- **Be Mindful of Language:** Avoid using inappropriate or offensive language. This includes, but is not limited to, comments or jokes that may be deemed offensive or insensitive.
- **Provide Clear and Specific Feedback:** When suggesting improvements or corrections, provide clear, specific, and actionable feedback in a constructive manner.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered unacceptable:

- **Harassment:** Harassment includes offensive comments related to race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, religion, or nationality.
- **Disruptive Behavior:** Behavior that consistently interrupts, disrupts, or hinders the work of others.

- **Discrimination:** Discrimination against individuals based on personal characteristics, identities, or affiliations is strictly prohibited.
- **Personal Attacks:** Aggressive, derogatory, or offensive comments or attacks toward others will not be tolerated.

## Reporting Issues

If you observe or experience any unacceptable behavior, please report it promptly:

All reports will be handled confidentially and professionally. We will take any necessary action to ensure a safe environment for all participants.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior will be reviewed and addressed by project maintainers. The maintainers reserve the right to take any actions necessary to uphold this Code of Conduct, including:
