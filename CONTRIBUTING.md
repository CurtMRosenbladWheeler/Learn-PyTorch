## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to uphold a respectful and collaborative environment. For details, please refer to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all kinds, including:

- Reporting issues or bugs
- Suggesting new features
- Submitting code improvements
- Writing or improving documentation
- Reviewing pull requests

Please ensure you have read and understood the project's [License](./LICENSE.md), as it outlines the restrictions on derivative works and commercial use.

## Issues and Feature Requests

To report a bug, suggest a new feature, or request an improvement:

1. **Search Existing Issues:** Check if there is already an open issue for your request.
2. **Open a New Issue:** If no issue exists, please open a new one. Provide a clear and detailed description of the problem or suggestion.
3. **Label Appropriately:** Use appropriate labels (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `feature request`) to help us categorize your submission.

## Code Contributions

We welcome code contributions that improve functionality, fix bugs, or enhance documentation. Hereâ€™s how to get started:

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button to create your own copy of the repository.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Learn-PyTorch-A-Mathematical-Perspective.git
   cd Learn-PyTorch-A-Mathematical-Perspective
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have all dependencies installed.
4. **Create a Branch:** Create a branch to isolate your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. **Start Coding:** Make your code changes on this branch.

### Writing Documentation

Clear and accurate documentation is critical for understanding complex mathematical concepts and implementations. Please follow these guidelines:

- Use concise, clear language and provide examples where applicable.
- When discussing mathematical equations, use LaTeX formatting to ensure clarity.
- Document all code thoroughly, especially if the code includes complex mathematical or technical steps.
- Add explanations or references for less common mathematical concepts or theorems.

## Pull Request Guidelines

1. **Create a Pull Request (PR):** Once you're ready, create a PR from your branch to the `main` branch.
2. **Add a Descriptive Title and Summary:** Include a clear title and detailed description of what your PR accomplishes.
3. **Link to Relevant Issues:** If your PR addresses an open issue, please reference it in the description (e.g., "Closes #10").
4. **Review Process:** PRs will be reviewed by project maintainers. Address all feedback promptly and professionally.
5. **Stay Up-to-Date:** If there are updates to `main`, rebase your branch as needed to resolve any conflicts.

### Code Style and Testing

- **Code Style:** Follow PEP 8 conventions for Python code.
- **Testing:** Include unit tests for any new functions or modules, and make sure all tests pass before submitting.
